# Interview-Frontend
Hello and thanks for taking the time to complete our interview developer test!

Feel free to do any code refactors you see fit, this is a Next.js project! 

## Build Setup

```bash
npm run dev
or
yarn dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying pages/index.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

API routes can be accessed on http://localhost:3000/api/hello. This endpoint can be edited in pages/api/hello.ts.

The pages/api directory is mapped to /api/*. Files in this directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.

## Tasks TODO
* Implement "Load Images". The result should look as following:
  ![demo](./static/demo.png)

## What we will examine:
* Clean production ready code
* Ability to fulfill the requirements
