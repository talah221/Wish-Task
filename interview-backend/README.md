# Interview-Backend
Hello and thanks for taking the time to complete our interview developer test!

Feel free to do any code refactors you see fit, but keep it in JS.

## Build Setup
```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

## Configs
```bash
rename .env.example to .env
```

## Tasks
* Implement the existing "API endpoints" to fetch images and merge them into one response
* The endpoint will be used by the front-end project
* Hint: Lib "node-fetch" is preinstalled
* Bonus: Repair the attached Dockerfile and make the project available from localhost


## API Endpoints

```

https://my-json-server.typicode.com/coing-dev/photo-api/images
``` 
## What we will examine:
* Clean production ready code
* Ability to fulfill the requirements
